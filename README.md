Name the file: song and add this to the game folder. (THe file was to big for github)

See if you can get to the black house ;).





HOW TO PLAY:

Walk around. Hover your mouse over the environment then click e to interact with it.
To get into houses, click the while next to the door (don't get right up onto it though it won't work)

Also one of the keys unlocks an ivisibly bridge but the bridge only shows up once you get click it so just spam the river where the path is once you get it.
